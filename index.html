        Hello, I am Liam Alexander Quinn, a graphic designer based in Naarm/Melbourne.
        I work at Weekdays, a design and branding studio, working with a bunch of cool hospitality businesses.
        I'm also head designer at Veraison, a formerly physical wine zine which is currently transitioning to a website.
        Before Weekdays, I was at Blackhearts & Sparrows as their in-house designer; working on campaigns, brand work,
        product designs, packaging, signage, and everything in between.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, most of my studio work has been designing and developing websites, motion graphics and video work.
        At heart I'm a playful concept guy with a lot of love for injecting work with a dose of humour and panache.
        Some examples of work and play are below. Want to chat? You can email me or simply call for a quote. Thanks.
      </p>
